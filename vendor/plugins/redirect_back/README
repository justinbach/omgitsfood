Makes it easier to redirect back to actions by storing the return path in the session.

Place this in application_controller.rb:

    include RedirectBack
    
Then, in a controller:

    before_filter :store_return_point, :only => [:list]

    def list
    end

    def edit
      # do your editing...
      redirect_back :action => "list"
    end
    
If redirect_back is accessed through an action which utilizes :store_return_point, it will use the path stored in the session to redirect to. Otherwise it will use the hash passed to it.

link_back can be used in views in exactly the same way:

    <%= link_back "Back", :action => "list" %>
